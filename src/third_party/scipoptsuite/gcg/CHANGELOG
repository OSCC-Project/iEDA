@section RN300 GCG 3.0.0
*************************

Features
--------

- new roundwise modular structure detection scheme:
  - detectors can implement three optional methods:
    - propagateSeeed : given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of decompositions that are a refinement of d
    - finsishSeeed: given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of decompositions that are a refinement of d and complete
    - postprocessSeeed: given a complete decomposition d the detector returns a set of complete decompositions
  - there is a current pool of partial decompositions (i.e. some conss and vars are open, initilized by empty decomposition (all vars and conss are open) or user decomposition )
  - in every detection round the refinement method of each active detector is called on each current partial detection and returns a (possibly empty) set of decompositions (possibly still partial but strictly more refined); afterwards the finishing method of each detector is called on each partial decomposition
  - after last round the postprocessing method of the corresponding detectors is called on each complete decomposition
  - duplicates of partial and complete are identified
  - constraint and variable classification according to several criteria reveals more problem structure, and in particular yield candidates for the number of blocks, that are used by graph partitioning detectors
  - detection process can run parallelized (in presence of multiple partial decompositions)
  - structure information concerning the original problem can be used when searching structure in the transformed problem, e.g. by "detect presolve detect"
  - more user interaction (see point "Command line interface" below for more information):
	- by command "explore" and inspecting found decompositions,
	- give partial decompositions,
	- directly modify found partial decompositions
  - new visualization methods for decompositions ('visualize' command in 'explore' submenu, family tree (experimental feature: finished decompositions can be seen as leaves in a forest, partial decompositions as inner nodes, ancestor descendant pairs are connected by edge ) )
  - new scores to evaluate found decompositions
- solve the problem with one single block if no decomposition is available ('SCIP mode')
- extended isomorph detector by the possibility to identify blocks which are identical
  w.r.t. signs (but not necessarily values) of coefficients.
- extended backtracking mechanism in diving heuristics:
  single backtracking in addition to limited discrepancy search in master variable diving;
  added branching on another variable and limited disc. search to original variable diving
- added menu item "write reportdecompositions" that creates a report of all decompositions in form of a .tex file
- Benders' decomposition mode has been added. The Benders' decomposition mode is activated by setting
  "relaxing/gcg/mode" to 1. When using the Benders' decomposition mode, the decompositions found by the detectors are
  used as the master and subproblems.
- Original mode has been added. The original mode allows the user to solve the original problem directly without any
  decomposition being performed. The original mode is selected by setting "relaxing/gcg/mode" to 2.
- new pricing scheme:
  - the pricing loop is now managed by a new class, the 'pricing controller'
  - pricing is now done by performing 'pricing jobs', which hold a pricing problem, a solver to be applied and some parameters (such as whether the solver is to be applied heuristically)
  - pricing jobs are organized in a priority queue, which is maintained by the pricing controller
  - the latter now also decides over premature abortion of the pricing loop
- own data structure for pricing problems which also holds solving statistics and results
- extension of heuristic pricing, which can now be performed in multiple rounds; in particular, the MIP and the CPLEX pricing solver can now be applied multiple times per pricing loop, with increasing node, solution limits or decreasing gap limts.
- new possibility to sort pricing problems: reliability sorting based only on the last few pricing rounds
- possibility to solve pricing problems 'chunk'-wise, i.e. to only regard a certain subset of pricing problems in a pricer call
- add price store similar to SCIP's sepa store for better column management
- interface change in pricing solvers:
  - solvers now pass their columns directly to the pricing storage rather than returning an array
  - GCG_DECL_SOLVERSOLVE and GCG_DECL_SOLVERSOLVEHEUR callbacks now also take the master SCIP instance as an input
  - new callback GCG_DECL_SOLVERUPDATE, called by the pricer when constraint, bound or objective function changes occur on a pricing problem; also fixes a bug in the CPLEX pricing solver
- new return type GCG_PRICINGSTATUS which replaces SCIP_STATUS in the pricing solvers

- add additional pricing and variable statistics
- add hybridization of dual variable smoothing with an ascent method
- restructure column pool similar to SCIP's cut pool
- parametrize pricing solver priorities
- added parameter heuristics/restmaster/pbheur to use restricted master heuristic as price-and-branch heuristic
- imitate SCIP's separation procedure in the basis separator by storing the number separation rounds in probing per node
- artificial variables can now be added in the first Farkas pricing iteration to make the restricted master problem
  feasible (including various options on setting the big M objective coefficients of these variables)
- new pricing solver that solves independent set problems heuristically using the cliquer library
- enable discretization when original problem is a mixed integer program; continuous variables are convexified
- solve original LP relaxation in the root node to get a first dual bound and to run some heuristics in the original problem

Performance improvements
-------------------------

- structure detection (default) is now applicable to MIPs with much larger dimensions (150.000 x 500000)

Data structures
----------------

- new internal data structure to handle partial decompositions; see class_seeed.h for more details
- new internal data structure to handle detection loops for different formulations (at the moment original and transformed formulation); see class_seeedpool.h for more information
- new internal data structure to handle constraint classification, each constraint classification is a partition of the constraints according a given criteria, used constraint classifiers:
	- number of nonzero entries
	- constraint type according to SCIP constraint handlers
	- constraint type according to MIPLIB2010 constraint classifiaction
	- constraint name: identity for names with removed digits
	- constraint name: levenshtein distance graph, for names according to nodes in the same connected component
- new internal data structure to handle variable classification, each variable classifier is a partition of the variables according to some criteria
	- SCIP variable type
	- objective coefficient
	- objective sign

Deleted and modified API functions
-----------------------------------

- detector callback DETECTSTRUCTURE is only called in optional legacy mode (legacy mode is detection of version 2.1.4 and completely indepedent from new detecion loop), detectors written by the user should be useable if their parameter detection/detectors/*/legacymode is set to TRUE

New API functions
-----------------

- detector callback PROPAGATESEEED, called during detection loop to refine partial decompositions, given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of decompositions that are a refinement of d
- detector callback FINISHSEEED, called during detection loop to finish partial decompositions, given a partial decomposition d the detector returns a set of complete decompositions that are a refinement of d

@page RN05 Release notes for GCG 0.5
@section RN050 GCG 0.5
*************************
bugfixes
- fixed problems with transfering bounds from the original program to the
  master program: when propagating a node, the bounds of all variables in
  the pricing problem and variables copied to the master are adjusted, for
  all master variables created by the pricer, it is checked whether they
  fulfill the current bounds
- fixed bug when disabling discretization approach

@page RN04 Release notes for GCG 0.4
@section RN040 GCG 0.4
*************************
design
- working SCIP represents the original problem
- read in problem is standard format (e.g., .lp-file, .mps-file) and
  corresponding blk-file
- the master problem is represented by a relaxator, which replaces the LP-solving
- separation is done by a separator included in the master SCIP, which calls the
  SCIPseparateSol() method in the original SCIP
- branching is done simultaneously in the master and in the original SCIP
- variables in the master are extreme points of conv(X) (and extreme rays, but
  functionality currently not implemented) -> convexification approach
- many identical pricing problems -> fat too much effort for pricing,
  especially farkas pricing!
- 2 constraint handler assure that nodes in the master SCIP are linked to
  nodes in the original SCIP and vice versa
- branching rules are implemented as branching rules in the master that
  have to define the additional callbacks specified in "type_branchgcg.h"

features
- in blk-file constraints can be forced to be copied to the master problem;
  all other constraints are added to a block, if they only contain variables
  of this block
- added possibility to use discretization approach, variables in the
  master then represent integer points in X, integrality in the master is
  demanded
- identification of identical blocks -> break symmetrie in the master
- 2 branching rules implemented so far:
  * branching on original variables (not possible if variable belongs to a
    block that has similar blocks in the problem), using pseudocost values
    to choose the variable to branch on
  * ryan-foster type of branching for identical blocks with set partitioning
    structure
- added GCGs own display plugin showing the number of LP iterations, of
  constraints, variables and cuts in the master
