/**
 * In our FM algorithm, we recompute the gain values of all node moves in the global move sequence
 * M := <m_1, ..., m_l> in parallel (see global_rollback.h).
 * Each node move m_i is of the form (u, V_i, V_j), which means that
 * node u is moved from block V_i to block V_j. Each node in this sequence is moved at most once.
 * Moreover, we assume that all node moves with an index < i are performed before m_i.
 *
 * The parallel gain recomputation algorithm iterates over all hyperedges e \in E in parallel.
 * We then iterate over the pins of e and compute some auxilliary data based on
 * which we then decide if we attribute an increase or reduction by w(e) to a moved pin.
 * This class implements the functions required by the rollback algorithm to recompute all gain values
 * for the connectivity metric.
