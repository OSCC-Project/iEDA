Description: 
  The released software constructs a binary tree over a set of clock sink 
  locations subject to a given global skew bound under Elmore or linear 
  delay models. No buffers insertion is used.

04/07/00: wrap BST/DME in C++  


*/


This package consists of 

*** bstdme.h  (wrap BST/DME in C++, users only need to include this header file  )
*** main.cxx (a sample file that shows how to use this package)


-- bst.cxx/bst.h    (main file) 
-- bst_sub1.cxx/bst_sub1.h  (common subroutines)
-- bst_sub2.cxx  (clustering, buffering, skew allocation)
-- bst_sub3.cxx/bst_sub3.h  (obstacle routing)
-- IME_code.cxx/IME_code.h  (For comparison between BME and IME )
-- foundation/*.h  (For the future reconstruction/development) 
-- Time.cxx/Time.h (Print out cpu time)

-- bst_header.h    ( define data structures and constants )
-- Global_var.h  ( Global variables shared among all files. )

   -- SunOS 5.7 Generic_106541-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2


  How to run the regression test?

** All the testcases are under ./BENCHMARKS

** use script ./regression for regresison test and
   comparison against the old regression result 

** The regression result of version 1.x is in
   ./BENCHMARKS/BST-1.x_regression_result*



  How to run this program?


** For the format of the input and outfile files, please read the 
   REAME and examples files under directory DOC. 
   
** For variable topologies.

    Example:  bst -i r1 -B  100  
        where -i specify the input is the benchmark r1
	      -B specify the allowed skew bound is 100 (pico-second)  
	  
    Outfile:
       topology: r1.top_B100
       xgraph files :
                r1.xg_B100  (routing solution in xgraph format) 
                r1_area.xg_B10 (tree of merging regions in xgraph format)
       The xgraph package can be obtained from 
        http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/xgraph.html

** For fixed topologies.

    example:  bst -i r1 -G r1.top_B100   -B 100

    where -G specifies that the topologies is given in file r1.top_B100

** Generate random test cases
   -N 99 will generate a file "n99" which has  99 points


   (The following functionality are NOT complete yet, but I plan to
   finish them in the future)


**  For different wire delay model 
    -D 0 (Linear delay model)
    -D 1 (Elmore delay model) (default)

** For non-uniform Layer parasitics
   -RES 2 specifies that Res. of layer2 is 2 times larger than R. of layer 1
   -CAP 2 specifies that Cap. of layer2 is 2 times larger than C. of layer 1

** For obstruction  
   -O   n99.block  read in the file n99.block which has obstacles information 

** For buffer insertion: 

   To set buffer linear model  
      -BRES 50 set Buffer Resistance to be 50 ohm
      -BCAP 50.0e-15 set Buffer Capacitance to be 50 ff.

   To set the number of buffers at each level
   -NCL  16 1  specifies that 
               16 buffers at the bottom level
               1  buffer  at the top level

05-11-2002: (try to fix the regression crash on PC/Linux platform).

* remove the following variables and the related codes.
   N_Skew_Samples
   Max_Delay_Skew
   Min_Delay_Skew
   Capac_Skew
   WL_Skew
   Niteration
   B_Niteration

* fix the crash in the fucntion print_merging_tree on PC/Linux, where 
   the array bound of char* a[20] overflows. 
  The solution is to use the C++ string to get around the array bound problem.


05-18-2002: take prescribed delays at each sinks.

"bst -N 99" will produce a file called n99, which can be used as 
 a sample input file with prescribed delays for a testcase with 99 sinks,  


05-31-2002: check if any errors in the input topology file.

06-03-2002: correct the way to draw a buffer, which
    cause a confusion to  Sherief Reda" <sreda@cs.ucsd.edu>
   



to-do list:
* add static to local functions 
* eliminate more un-used codes
* root_id in update_Cluster
* look into any potential problem on array bound problem.
